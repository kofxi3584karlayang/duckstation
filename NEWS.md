- 2020/12/25: Partial texture replacement support added. For now, this is only applicable to a small number of games which upload backgrounds to video RAM every frame. Dumping and replacement options are available in `Advanced Settings`.
- 2020/12/22: PGXP Depth Buffer enhancement added. This enhancement can eliminate "polygon fighting" in games, by giving the PS1 the depth buffer it never had. Compatibility is rather low at the moment, but for the games it does work in, it works very well. The depth buffer will be made available to postprocessing shaders in the future, enabling  effects such as SSAO.
- 2020/12/21: DuckStation now has two releases - Development and Preview. New features will appear in Preview first, and make their way to the Development release a few days later. To switch to preview, update to the latest development build (older builds will update to development), change the channel from `latest` to `preview` in general settings, and click `Check for Updates`.
